    "Tiktoken can convert any text into tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we use the `encoding_for_model` function to get a token encoder for the embedding model we're using. To calculate the total number of tokens, we use the following code.

This code is much more concise and efficient than looping through the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we calculate the price by multiplying `total_tokens` by `cost_per_1k_tokens` over `1000`, and print the result.\n",
